# DupeVidFinder
AutoIt Script that finds duplicate videofiles through histogram fingerprinting and comparison
It depends in ffmpeg and MediaInfo.dll
I lost the source code and final script in many hdd crashes and have to work on an old version to get it to work again.
I'm using github now to never loose my work again :)
